# Simple-RoadMap-Tracker
Roadmap Tracker is a web app built with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript that lets users import TXT roadmaps, auto-generate tasks, and mark them complete with timestamps. Progress is saved locally using localStorage and shown in a dynamic pie chart dashboard for clear tracking of completed vs pending tasks.

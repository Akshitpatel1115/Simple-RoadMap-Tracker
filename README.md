# 📍 Roadmap Tracker

A clean and interactive **Roadmap Tracker** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It helps users track their learning progress by uploading a `.txt` file containing tasks — no manual input needed!

This tracker automatically saves progress, visualizes completion with charts, and motivates users when all tasks are done 🎯

## 🚀 Features

### 📂 Task Upload
- Tasks are **added by uploading a `.txt` file** (each line = one task).  
- No need to manually create or edit tasks.  

### ✅ Progress Tracking
- Check or uncheck tasks to mark them **complete** or **pending**.  
- Live **progress bar** and **Chart.js graph** visualize overall completion.  

### 🎉 Motivational Feedback
- When all tasks are marked complete:
  - A **positive message** appears 🎊  
  - A **summary table** is displayed showing each task’s title and **completion date**.  
- If any task becomes pending again:
  - The **message and table automatically hide** — keeping UI clean and smart.  

### 💾 LocalStorage Support
- All uploaded roadmaps and task progress are saved in **LocalStorage**.  
- Progress stays intact even after refreshing or reopening the page.  

### 📊 Saved Roadmaps
- Manage and switch between multiple saved roadmaps.  
- Perfect for tracking different goals or subjects easily.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Upload a `.txt` file — each line becomes a separate task.  
2. Check off tasks as you complete them.  
3. When all tasks are done:
   - 🎉 A **positive message** is shown.  
   - 🗓️ A **summary table** appears with completion dates.  
4. If any task is unchecked later:
   - The message and table automatically disappear.
